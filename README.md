# Sam Felton's Website

## About

This repo hosts my personal website, an intentionally evergreen site that should take you to all the links you need to find what I'm up to! It's written in Astro and Tailwind because I like ctrl clicking on elements to see their styles, even if I could have surely built this with plain html and css.

## Content

Hi, I'm Sam! I'm a developer passionate about intuitive design, on a mission to become a truly full stack developer.

Here's a bunch of links to my stuff. Enjoy!
